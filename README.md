# SeamCarver

Implements the algorithm described by the famous 2007 paper ["Seam carving for content-aware image resizing"](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/courses/15-463/2007_fall/hw/proj2/imret.pdf).

As a simple example, this original photo can be resized by specifying any smaller dimensions.![](https://github.com/justintranjt/SeamCarver/blob/master/Capture2.png)

A photo that specifies a smaller width will result in the following photo with a clear, large seam removed in the yellow area.![](https://github.com/justintranjt/SeamCarver/blob/master/Capture.PNG)

Other examples with photos that can apply the seam carving property more appropriately can be found in the paper.
